# PageSaver
I made this script so I can use it to save webpages (as a part of learning python) into a spical folder, then added the ability to list saved pages and view them with 'list' and 'open' commands.
This script is very basic but if you by any chance want to use it you should change the name of the home directory to your home directory's name since I didn't know how to make the script automaticly read the name of the user's home directory.
